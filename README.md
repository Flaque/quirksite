# üêô quirk

Quirk is a crossplatform, GPL-licensed, [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Declining_effectiveness)
app built in React Native / Expo.

Unlike many CBT apps, it's fairly unbiased in what you use it for; it doesn't ask about your mood or ask you
to depression-specific CBT exercises. That makes it fairly quick and discreet to use, especially in a public
setting.

# Design

Quirk's goal is to be both inviting and focused. It should be _really_ easy to enter in a thought; people frequently enter these in public settings and need to do it fairly quickly. It also should not cause any increased frustration.

## Color Palette

To bootstrap this, we're just using [a pre-canned, but fairly muted, color palette.](https://flatuicolors.com/palette/ru)

## Other Stupid Design Logic

I'm not really a designer, but I do like to engage in _stupid design logic_ for why things are a certain way. Quirk has
a particular style, but it's one I ripped off from a bunch of other apps.

Some things are muted because they're dumb and not the important bits. But the important bits are big, gigantic works of in-your-face crunchy juicy goodness. Titles should be bold, the boldyest bold you got. Only got one thing to say? Make [that thing a full screen giant, towering over mortals.](https://i.imgur.com/zcplBkP.png)

Illustrations should be excessively cute and burst with as much personality as your artistic talent can muster. None of that sleek silicon valley business-casual airplane art. Nah. **Give me bubbles and smiles.** Draw little dudes and [make them eat each other.](https://i.imgur.com/JYM9CbA.png) We're making a healthy-cool app here, not some collared-shirt-wearing fintech money-market manstravaganza.

When I first started making things, I made those websites that just threw every color you could on the page and it looked awful. Eventually I noticed it looked awful and then became super cautious about doing anything remotely interesting. I think I'm back in a happy medium. The UI design tweeks I stole from a lot of other apps, this general thinking comes from [the game design concept of "Juice."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=216_5nu4aVQ)
